# NixieThemes
A collection of different skins/themes for the Elekstube IPS clock. 

Feel free to contribute your favorite clockfaces!
The images should be:
- at least 10 files corresponding to the digits 0-9
- in 24-bit BMP format
- 135 pixels wide
- 1-240 pixels high. The original software by Elekstube only accepts images with the full 240px height. The usermod for WLED will center smaller images vertically.

Optionally, you can also add a binary image in RGB565 format, which saves a bit of filesystme space when using the WLED usermod.
You can use https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter to convert your .bmp files to .bin (settings `True color` and `Binary RGB565`)
